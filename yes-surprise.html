        Laurenn, I am so lucky to spend each day with you. I thank God every single day for blessing me with someone who loves me and cares for me the way you do.
        I also thank God for blessing me with someone who cares about my life, keeps me accountable, and makes me a better person each day.
    </p>

        Thank you for showering me with love. 
        Thank you for thinking about things with my best interest in mind. 
        Thank you for always listening to me and giving me your honest thoughts.
    </p>

        I am so excited to spend the rest of my life with you and I can't express enough how happy I am. 
        I hope no matter what challenges we face, we can face them together, and overcome them together as well.
        I will always be in your corner, rooting and supporting you, and I know you are in mine doing the same. 
        I couldn't ask for a better girlfriend -> fiance -> wife...

        I love you so so so much Laurenn
